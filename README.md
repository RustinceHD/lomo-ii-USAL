This repository houses the source code and documentation for the LOMO-II project, which is part of the Operating Systems II course. LOMO-II is a train simulation program built using the WIN32 API and a custom Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The simulation involves managing trains on a circuit, detecting deadlocks, and optimizing CPU usage.
