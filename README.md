Introduction

In this project, we aim to create a realistic train simulation that utilizes the WIN32 API. The simulation involves managing multiple trains on a circuit, and it includes features such as deadlock detection and CPU usage optimization.
Features

   Dynamic Train Movement: Trains move dynamically on the circuit.
   Deadlock Detection: The program can detect and report deadlocks.
   CPU Optimization: Designed to minimize CPU usage.
   WIN32 API: Utilizes the powerful features of the WIN32 API for a Windows-based simulation.
   DLL Integration: Includes a custom Dynamic Link Library (DLL) for core functionality.

Getting Started

To get started with LOMO-II, follow these steps:

   Clone the repository to your local machine.
   Ensure you have the required development environment for WIN32 API applications set up.
   Build the project using the provided lomo2.cpp source file.
   Link the project with the lomo2.dll Dynamic Link Library.

Usage

Once you have built and linked the project, you can run the lomo2.exe executable to start the train simulation. The simulation will run for one minute unless you stop it by pressing CTRL+C.

Please refer to the course materials and documentation for detailed usage instructions and function descriptions.
